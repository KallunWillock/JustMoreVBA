    '                   12 Sep 2022 - Updated API declaration and related data types for 64bit compatibility
    '                   23 Jun 2023 - Updated code - streamlined per xlBangAnywhere
    '* URL:             https://github.dev/KallunWillock/JustMoreVBA/blob/main/Images/modImages_PastePicture.bas
    '* DESCRIPTION:     Creates a standard Picture object from the contents of the clipboard. This stdole.stdPicture can then be assigned to (for example) 
    '                   an Image control on a userform. The code in this module has been derived from a number of sources discovered on MSDN.
    '* NOTES:           23 June 2023 - A number of necessary updates / stylistic adjustments to the Stephen Bullen's code. 
    '                   (1) Replaced xlBitmap and xlPicture constants - these are meaningless in the rest of the VBA ecosystem.
    '                   (2) API Declarations - various corrections
    '                   (3) Shortened code / removed and rewrote comments
    '* USAGE:           Set Image1.Picture = PastePicture(vbaBitmap)
    '* PROCEDURES:
    '    PastePicture   Public function used to assign image on clipboard to stdOle.stdPicture object
    '    CreatePicture  Private function to convert a bitmap or metafile handle to an OLE reference
    '    fnOLEError     Private function that returns the error text for an OLE error code
